# 4.4. Assessment of the Agreement of the Relationships of Transcripts with Age between the Sexes

Before any analysis, the influence of sex in the context of gene expression throughout life was evaluated to remove transcripts with different behaviours between men and women. More specifically, it was evaluated whether the transcripts had the same correlation direction \(Spearman\) between their expression profile and age for both sexes. For this, two datasets were created, similar to ageCollapsed, each containing only samples of each gender \(1003 samples of women and 761 of men\). Then, the direction of the transcripts correlated with age \(\|Rho\| &gt; 0.35\) was evaluated and 38 transcripts with opposite directions, called SexGenes, were identified. The SexGenes, which were removed from the following analyses, are listed in the supplementary table \(Appendix A - SexGenes Table\) and represented by the black dots in Figure 4.5.
