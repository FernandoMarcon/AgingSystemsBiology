# Objectives

## Main goal

Find transcriptional programs related to immunosenescence.

## Secondary goals

Find transcripts with a highly age-related expression profile, called AgingGenes.

Identify network, its modules, of transcripts co-expressed throughout life, called AgingNet.

Evaluate the biological processes related to AgingGenes and AgingNet modules and how they could be associated with the immunosenescence phenotype.

Identify moments in life in which AgingGenes and AgingNet undergo changes in their transcriptional profiles.
