# 3.2. Reannotation of Probes in Microarrays

###  <a id="docs-internal-guid-d126b47d-7fff-cde2-40c5-b6a9c4caaeb6"></a>

Microarrays are made up of several short-length probes that test different parts of the same transcript, which may or may not be from a protein-coding gene. However, because many platforms were developed years ago, the functional annotation of each transcript may be out of date. Therefore, the selected platforms were re-annotated using more recent versions of databases, such as Gencode \(HARROW et al., 2012\), Noncode \(ZHAO et al., 2016\), LNCipedia \(VOLDERS et al., 2013\) and MiTranscriptome \(IYER et al., 2015\) \(Figure 3.2\). Through intersections between genomic coordinates, probes from each platform were confirmed or assigned to new transcripts, such as coding genes, non-coding RNAs, among others.
